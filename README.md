# ðŸ§° Car Diagnosis Expert System (Prolog)

A rule-based expert system designed to help users diagnose common car problems through interactive symptom-based questions. This AI project uses **Prolog** and implements **backward chaining**, simulating expert mechanic reasoning in a user-friendly format.

## ðŸ’¡ Overview

This system asks a series of questions related to car symptoms and evaluates user input using logic-based rules to suggest possible diagnoses. Diagnoses are grouped by car system (e.g., Electrical, Cooling), with human-readable explanations.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies

- **Prolog** (SWI-Prolog recommended)
- Logical reasoning (Backward Chaining)
- Rule-based system
- Dynamic fact assertion


## ðŸš€ How to Run

Make sure you have SWI-Prolog installed. Then run:

```bash
swipl
?- [diagnosis].
?- run_diagnosis.
```

Follow the prompts to answer questions. The system will infer potential car problems based on your inputs and display results grouped by system area.
